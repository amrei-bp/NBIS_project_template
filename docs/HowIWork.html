# How I work

This presentation demonstrates how I work and why I use Nextflow,
version control, and containers in my support work.

( I elaborate further on slides in the presenter notes (shortcut key: `p`)).

???

The aim of this presentation is to provide useful information to
be able to continue working on these analyses. The tools are
a steep learning curve, particularly if you're not used to
working in this way. However, these tools greatly improve
both reproducibility and working efficiency if one knows how.

## What I (often) use

* A SNIC compute allocation on Uppmax.
* A SNIC storage allocation on Uppmax (not needed for small data sets).
* Docker installed on my personal computer.
* Singularity on Uppmax.
* git on my personal computer and on Uppmax.
* A Github account.
* A conda environment with Nextflow installed (local, Uppmax).
* The workflow manager Nextflow.
* An editor (Atom, Vim).

Why?

This is how you reproduce my data analysis.


```bash
cd /proj/snic20XX-YY-ZZ/NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;/analyses/&lt;date&gt;_&lt;analysis&gt;/
conda activate /proj/snic20XX-YY-ZZ/NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;/conda/nextflow-env
./run_nextflow.sh
```

???

Swedish research groups are encouraged to use the SNIC resources at Uppmax for
large scale data processing. If you're only doing computations, then you're recommended
to use a SNIC compute allocation, however, if you have a need to store large
amounts of data (for the duration of the project), then you should also use
a SNIC storage allocation too.

I work both locally on my personal computer and Uppmax. Using the widely supported
container system Docker means I have an easier time managing and porting
software installations. Although Uppmax doesn't support Docker for various
security reasons, it does support Singularity which is able to use container images
from Docker. Using Container systems means I do not have to rely on computer
administrators to install tools for me. Many bioinformatic tools are
also available as containers through Biocontainers, meaning you can just use
the container and get on with your analyses.

Version control tools like Git are a great tool to help keep work organised,
and in a way, backed up. Using git branches are a particularly powerful way
to keep both a working copy of your analysis, and work on different exploratory
analyses at the same time. It can also be useful for demonstrating work
attribution (and accountability). Web-based git repositories such as Github,
also provide a way of publishing your work (or keeping it private), can
function as a backup of sorts, and provide other useful tools such as
automated actions, or Wiki spaces.

Conda (or mamba; drop-in replacement for conda) is a software package manager,
however the main difference to containerised software
is that the software environment is not self-contained like containers are.
You can work with tools both in your environment and outside, which is particularly
useful for a tool like Nextflow. One of Nextflow's strengths is that it can
work on a wide variety of computing platforms, however in order to do so in a
containerized environment would mean every tool Nextflow supports would need
to be included and would need to be configured to use the correct files
outside the container - a hugely complex process. It's much simpler to
provide an environment for Nextflow and allow it to interact with whatever your
compute system uses. The added benefit of using a conda environment is that
it can be set up for everyone part of the project, easing installation issues.  

Nextflow is a workflow manager. I use it to manage the flow of scripts so I know
data provenance from beginning to end. It has very good file handing and scaling
properties, making script writing simpler. I can write a Nextflow process for a single
set of inputs and not worry too much about coding it for multiple files. That
process can also be assigned a container, providing a running environment which
doesn't have software conflicts with other things that need to be run.

Editors with syntax highlighting and git integrations are useful coding tools.
My preferences are Atom and Vim, but there are many other options, e.g. the popular
VScode.

---

## Summary of work habits

- Use an organised folder structure.  
- Make a private Project repository on Github, and clone it on Uppmax and then locally.
- Have a stable `main` git branch, and use git branches for feature development
and exploratory analyses.
- Make a test data set for development purposes.
- Use toy examples for exploring Nextflow functionality.
- Write processes in a modular way to use existing containers.
- Use Docker to make containers for tools which are not available as containers.
- Use Nextflow to manage intermediate files.
- If a script is failing, debug it in the work directory.
- parameters and config are included in version control.

???

The structure I've found that works well for me is:
```
/proj/snic20XX-YY-ZZ/NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;/        (SNIC Compute Allocation)
 |
 | - README.md                                 Project details summary
 |
 | - analyses/                                 Analysis configuration files
 |   | - YYYY-MM-DD_workflow_dev                 Configuration to use test data
 |   \ - YYYY-MM-DD_full_data_analysis           Configuration to use all the data
 | - conda/nextflow-env                        Conda Environment containing tools and dependancies to run Nextflow
 | - docs/                                     Project documentation
 \ - workflow/                                 Nextflow workflow
     | - bin                                     Custom script folder
     | - configs                                 General workflow configuration
     \ - containers                              Custom container definitions

/proj/snic20xx-yy-zz/                          (SNIC Storage Allocation)
 |
 | - nobackup/nxf-work                         Intermediate analysis files
 \ - NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;_results/                Analysis results
```

This is flexible enough for both data analysis and pipeline development
projects.

---

## Starting a support project.

- Make a private Project repository from my Template repository on Github.
    1. Select `New Repository` on Github from the `+` symbol in the top right corner.
    1. Select `mahesh-panchal/NBIS_project_template` in `Repository template`.
    1. Change `owner` to `NBISweden`.
    1. Provide a repository name following `SMS-&lt;id&gt;-&lt;year&gt;-&lt;short_description&gt;`.
    1. Ensure repository is private, then click Create repository.
    1. Add a link to the Redmine Project in the URL box.
- Clone it into the SNIC Compute project.
    
    ```bash
    cd /proj/snic20XX-YY-ZZ
    git clone git@github.com:NBISweden/SMS-&lt;id&gt;-&lt;year&gt;-&lt;short_description&gt;.git NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;
    ```
- Clone the SNIC compute project locally.
    
    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/Projects
    git clone &lt;user&gt;@rackham.uppmax.uu.se:/proj/snic20XX-YY-ZZ/NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;
    ```
- Update README in the repository.

???

I've made myself a [Template](https://github.com/mahesh-panchal/NBIS_project_template)
from which to start working from. It provides:
- The organised folder structure I use for projects (`analyses`, `docs`, `workflow`).
- Skeleton files to quickly start prototyping.
- A How I work, so others can see how I use the tools here and continue working.

As I will primarily run analyses on Uppmax, I use Github as a backup, and push
my local work directly to Uppmax saving a step. This means however the Uppmax
active branch (usually `main`) must be different from my local branch ( usually
a feature branch ) when I `git push`.

Once the repositories are cloned, I update the README with the project info,
tasks to be performed, and Uppmax directories.

---

## Make a test dataset

A good test data set should be small, but have enough data to get
a decent portion of the way into the analysis.

Subsample Paired-end Illumina data:

```bash
FRACTION=0.1
SEED=100
seqtk sample -s"$SEED" "$READ1" "$FRACTION" | gzip -c &gt; "${READ1/_R1./_R1.subsampled.}" &amp;
seqtk sample -s"$SEED" "$READ2" "$FRACTION" | gzip -c &gt; "${READ1/_R2./_R2.subsampled.}"
wait
```

Subsample a bam file:

```bash
FRACTION=0.10
samtools view -b -@ "${CPUS:-10}" -s "$FRACTION" -o "${PREFIX}.subsampled_${FRACTION}.subreads.bam" "${PREFIX}.subreads.bam"
```

Subsample a CSV file:

```bash
NUM_RECORDS=1000
shuf -n "$NUM_RECORDS" "${PREFIX}.csv" &gt; "${PREFIX}.subsampled_${NUM_RECORDS}.csv"  
```

???

A good place to start working is to make a test data set from the User's data.
This makes prototyping your processes faster when you come to test if it runs.
I inevitably make mistakes coding, and I don't want it running for a long time
if I can help it.

A good test dataset just needs enough data to get far enough while you're
prototyping your Nextflow processes. Enabling reentrancy in Nextflow
(`-resume`) will mean you can also let the workflow run, and then it
continues from the last successfully completed processes the next time.

Store it in `nobackup` on the SNIC storage allocation. I use a script
to make sure I know how to recreate it, and what was used as input.

---

## Make the running environment

Make a shared conda environment for everyone in the project.


```bash
PROJECT_DIR=/proj/snic20XX-YY-ZZ/NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;
mamba env create --prefix "$PROJECT_DIR/conda/nextflow-env" \
  -f "$PROJECT_DIR/workflow/nextflow_conda-env.yml"
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate /proj/snic20XX-YY-ZZ/NBIS_support_&lt;id&gt;/conda/nextflow-env
```

Deactivate the environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

???

Conda is a software package manager. It makes it easy to install tools
into custom environments. Several tools can be installed into
an environment, and along with it all the libraries and dependancies it
needs. A conda environment is a double-edged sword in that, when activated,
it is not isolated from the users normal environment. This makes it ideal
for running a software like Nextflow, but perhaps troublesome for others.

Mamba is another software intended to be a drop-in replacement for Conda.
A primary advantage is faster building of environments, through
better package dependancy resolution.

Conda environments are activated using `conda activate &lt;environment&gt;`
and deactivated using `conda deactivate`.

Conda is enabled on Uppmax using `module load conda`.

---

## Prototyping

- Stable `main` git branch.
- Mostly stable `dev` git branch - develop a line of analysis.
- Feature branch to try stuff.

.center[
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:34c86360-8dea-4be4-92f7-6597d4d5bfae/02%20Feature%20branches.svg?cdnVersion=1783" alt="The git flow model." width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The git flow model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

Make a new branch.

```bash
git checkout -b &lt;new_feature&gt;
```

---

Add a process into the workflow:

```groovy
process &lt;name&gt; {
  
  &lt;directives&gt;
  conda (params.enable_conda ? "&lt;channel&gt;::&lt;software&gt;=&lt;version&gt;" : null)
  if (workflow.containerEngine == 'singularity' &amp;&amp; !params.singularity_pull_docker_container) {
    container "https://&lt;singularity_image_url&gt;/&lt;software&gt;:&lt;version+build&gt;"
  } else {
    container "&lt;docker_image_url&gt;/&lt;software&gt;:&lt;version+build&gt;"
  }
    
  input:
  path &lt;filename_var&gt;

  output:
  path "&lt;filename&gt;", emit: &lt;file_type&gt;
  path "*"  // Captures everything. Use when you don't know what the output is.

  script:
  """
  """
    
}
```

---

Pass the appropriate input channel(s) in the `workflow` block.


```groovy
workflow {
  
  Channel.fromFilePairs(params.reads)
    .set { input_ch }
    
  FASTQC (input_ch)
  FASTP (input_ch)
  ASSEMBLE (FASTP.out.trimmed_reads)
  
}
```

Add the process resources to the configs.


```groovy
process {
  withName 'FASTQC' {
    cpus = 4
    time = '1h'
  }
  withName 'FASTP' {
    cpus = 4
    time = '2h'
  }
}
```

???

- Nextflow processes are kept as modular as possible, often limiting them to a
single tool. The benefits are that one can often use public images for
a process, reducing build time. Environments are small, meaning low build
time, and low conflict potential. Since projects are often incrementally
developed, this reduces the need to rebuild images or environments, saving time.
- Try to use existing containers (public images) when possible. When a container
must be created, I use Docker to make a local image, test, and then push it to
Github packages to keep it private to the project.
The [README.md](../workflow/containers/README.md) in the `workflow/containers` directory
has more information on creating custom containers.

- Nextflow has a large selection of channel operators (functions that manipulate
process input), which can manipulate input into any format you need. It can be
difficult to get the desired input combination first time, and you do not want to
experiment on your long running data sets to find out what works. To understand
what a Nextflow construct does, write toy examples like in
[Nextflow Patterns](http://nextflow-io.github.io/patterns/index.html).
Nextflow also has a (GUI) console mode to test syntax (`nextflow console`).

---

## Prototyping

- A folder under `analyses` for development (`YYYY-MM-DD_workflow_dev`)
    - `params.config` points to test data.
    - I use `YYYY-MM-DD` for labeling folders to provide a natural ordering.

- Run stuff and break it.
    - Activate conda environment.
    - `run_nextflow.sh`
    - Nextflow prints the working directory when a process fails.

???

1. Test with the test data. The parameter config contains a directive
to resume the workflow from the last successfully executed process (`resume = true`).

---

## Troubleshooting a Nextflow process

If a process fails to run, Nextflow reports the Nextflow working directory it failed in.
Change directory to that folder:


```bash
cd /path/to/nextflow/workdir/&lt;xx&gt;/&lt;hashstring&gt;
```


```bash
.command.begin      Script to execute before process script
.command.err        Error stream log
.command.log        Combined stream log
.command.out        Output stream log
.command.run        Run script - runs .command.sh in the correct environment.
.command.sh         Process script.
.exitcode
```

Clean up redundant working directories with 

```bash
nextflow clean -f [ -before ] &lt;job_id&gt;`.
```
Use `nextflow log` to get `&lt;job_id&gt;`.

???

Every process plus set of inputs is run in it's own directory. When a process fails,
Nextflow will tell you the working directory where it was trying to run the process from.

In that folder there are several hidden files starting with `.`.
The `.command.sh` contains the process script.
You can modify this and execute it, but it runs in your current environment ( i.e.,
outside the container). To run the modified `.command.sh` inside the container,
you should run `.command.run`, either directly on a worker node ( e.g. `bash .command.run`)
or submit it to the cluster (e.g. `sbatch .command.run`). One can debug the process
script in this way, incorporate changes to the Nextflow workflow, and continue.

Be wary of long running commands, and use toy data to make something work.
For example:

```bash
blastx ...                                      # Long run time
awk '&lt;complex script&gt;' &lt;blast_output&gt;           # Quick
```
Comment out blastx and run awk with toy data. Alternatively comment out the
awk, let it finish successfully, and use the cached output.

Once you're done, use `nextflow clean -f [-before] &lt;job_id&gt;` to clean up
redundant working directories.

---

## Prototyping

Once it works, merge with the existing development branch or main branch.


```bash
# Update main branch with changes from origin
git checkout main
git pull --rebase

# merge updates to main into new process branch
git checkout &lt;new_feature&gt;
git rebase main
# IMPORTANT: It is your responsibility to resolve conflicts with stable code

# Switch to main and merge new process
git checkout main
git merge &lt;new_feature&gt;
git branch -d &lt;new_feature&gt; # delete new feature
```

.pull-left[
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:c6db91c1-1343-4d45-8c93-bdba910b9506/02%20Branch-1%20kopiera.png?cdnVersion=1783" alt="Git merge." width="60%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Git merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]
.pull-right[
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:4e576671-1b7f-43db-afb5-cf8db8df8e4a/01%20What%20is%20git%20rebase.svg?cdnVersion=1783" alt="Git rebase." width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Git rebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

???

Merging changes is usually as simple as the last few lines, but sometimes
one needs a little more.
Every so often I will make a small change directly on Github. This means
I need to update those changes locally. Then I also need to incorporate
that change into my development branch.

There are two ways of merging work.
- `merge` will add the changes on top of your last commit, adding to the
git history of commits.
- `rebase` unapplies your commits, applies the changes, and reapplies your
commits.
