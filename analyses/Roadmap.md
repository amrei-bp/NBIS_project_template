# Roadmap

This roadmap communicates the strategy followed to obtain the end results.
This is useful for longer projects to describe how and why certain analyses
were performed, and which analyses lead to what.

## Overview

Use a mermaid diagram to visually describe how folders relate each other.
`flowchart` is an example, but other types of chart can be used to display the
folder relationships.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  01Dev [ YYYY-MM-DD_dev_analysis ] -> 01Full [ YYYY-MM-DD_full_analysis ]
```

## YYYY-MM-DD_workflow_dev

###Â Objective: 

Workflow development folder. Explain what the code is trying to achieve.

### Result:

A quality check workflow was successfully developed. Include a path to the result.

### Status:

- In use
- Retired
- Abandoned

## YYYY-MM-DD_full_analysis

### Objective: 

Analyse all the data

### Result:

Describe result. Include a path to the result.

### Status:

- In use
- Retired
- Abandoned
